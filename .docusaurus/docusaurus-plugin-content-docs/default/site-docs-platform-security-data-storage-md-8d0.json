  "description": "Client data is stored in a document database cluster. All database keys are prefixed by organization, team, and individual user account identifiers and are thus constrainable at any of these levels. Data access and viewing privileges are defined accordingly. The Quiklyâ„¢ document database is replicated and highly-available using Kubernetes. Individual nodes in our database cluster use standard LUKS for data encryption at rest. All internal traffic in our database cluster as well as our compute cluster is encrypted in-flight via TLS.",
