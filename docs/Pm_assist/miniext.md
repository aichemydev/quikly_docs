# PM Designer - Get Started


Getting started with PM Designer is easy!

You can install the extension with just a click and start using it as soon as you finish downloading.

*We will have a version on the store later*

For now, we will provide you with a zip file, you can install it by extracting files.

Once you got the zip file go to your browser ( we support Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc...)                                                     
Right now, I will show you how to install it on Chrome - you can do the same with other browsers.

Instructions: 

1. Go to Chrome tab
2. On the top-right, click on three dots (vertical ellipsis)
3. Find `More tools` then `Extensions`
